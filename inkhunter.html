            <h3> summary </h3>
            <p>For my UI/UX course, I partnered with three other students to design an interface for an emerging startup - based only on their mission statement, and ignoring any pre-existing designs. The startup that we chose was <a href="http://inkhunter.tattoo/">InkHunter</a>, a very cool AR-based startup that allows users to “try on” a tattoo to see how it would look on their skin. We chose to make a mobile app, in order to make use of smartphones’ augmented reality capabilities.</p>
            <p>This also served as an opportunity for us to all try intense iterative design, from rough sketches of ideas all the way to a hifi app mockup. We were also lucky enough to be given the chance to use an eye tracker for this project, and to generate more interesting data worth analyzing.</p>

            <h3> start: sketches </h3>
            <img src="./photos/inkhunter/sketch.png" alt="rough sketch of mobile app layout">
            <p>The sketch that I created was modeled around an artist vs. customer dichotomy. In this model, artists would curate galleries of their tattoo designs and use Inkhunter to advertise to potential customers. Customers would be able to browse for artists based near them, try out tattoos using the app’s A/R camera features, and potentially travel to the artist whose design they like best and get a real tattoo. </p>

        <div class="first hifi">
            <h3> first step: hifi mockup & critique session </h3>
            <img src="./photos/inkhunter/hifi1.png" alt="first hifi mockup">
            <p>In the first iteration of our prototype, we used Figma to collaboratively create a hifi mockup amongst the four of us. In this mockup, we combined elements from each of the initial sketches that our group members did. This initial mockup is viewable <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/aJbJktEq8RvmG3XMSQSK1Cgr/Iterative-Design%3A-InkHunter?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down">here</a>. Our primary goals were to 1) provide a space for verified tattoo artists to upload and maintain a personal gallery of work, and 2) allow users to be able to 'try on' designs from tattoo artists, as well as having the freedom to try on their own designs. Essentially, we wanted to cater to two different user bases in this app.</p>
            <p>We took this mockup to a critique session, in which groups presented their initial mockup, and received critiques from other groups in the course. Most liked the app’s aesthetic, and appreciated the relatively simple layout. However, many said that they would not have understood the app’s purpose without our verbal explanations. They were confused about the difference between “personal” and “public” profiles, the landing page, and the meaning of different buttons. Additionally, while they appreciated the app’s social capabilities, they said that they were by far the least important element.</p>

            <h3> second step: hifi mockup (improved) </h3>
            <img src="./photos/inkhunter/hifi2.png" alt="second hifi mockup">
            <p>In doing the critique session, we were able to take away several important points in iterating on our design to make it more user-friendly. Our app design was trying to fill too many roles at once, and a result, the interface was clunky and confusing.</p>
            <p>In the second iteration, viewable <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/bHywNndKnT76kDsMpep7cu/Iterative-Design%3A-InkHunter-(Version-2.0)?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down">here</a>, we pared down the app to its most important feature: A/R tattoos. In practice, that meant eliminating the social elements (i.e. the profile pages and the dashboard), and making it essentially a glorified A/R camera. We also added onboarding, so that the user could understand how to use the app upon first entering.</p>

        <div class="eyetracking">
            <h3> third step: eyetracking </h3>
            <img src="./photos/inkhunter/heatmap.png" alt="heatmap result">
            <p>With this final iteration of our hifi prototype done, we used an eye tracker to analyze user engagement with our interface. We constructed a task for a user to perform with our prototype, and hypothesized about the resulting time per screen and eye movement. Our task was for the user to pick the black and white flower design, take a picture with it, and save the ensuing picture to their camera roll.</p>
            <p>Our two hypotheses were as follows. [1] On the home page, the user’s eye will be drawn to the bottom of the screen, because we have a brightly colored button that will attract the user’s attention on a mostly monotone page. [2] In order to take a picture with the specified tattoo design, the user will start on the homepage, follow a series of onboarding screens to learn how to use the app, select the design from their pictures, take a picture, edit the picture, and then save the final product to their camera roll.</p>
            <p>The data from this eye tracking session helped to support both of our hypotheses. [1] On the first page, our tester’s gaze focused mainly on the bottom left of the screen - we also observed that the calibration of the eye-tracker was slightly off (perhaps due to the contacts that our tester was wearing), an issue that persisted despite multiple attempts to recalibrate. [2] The eye tracking data also supported our hypothesis for the order in which these pages are navigated - the user was able to successfully navigate through to our objective.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3> reflection </h3>
            <p>This was a really cool project, not only because of the eyetracking (!!!) but also because of the opportunity to collaboratively come up with a design. I enjoyed the opportunity to see other people's initial sketches for an object, and to hear feedback from other people on how to improve our work. It was super awesome to be able to work with others to iterate upon on a single shared design, and to have the experience of having to justify one's reasonings behind designing something the way it is.</p>
